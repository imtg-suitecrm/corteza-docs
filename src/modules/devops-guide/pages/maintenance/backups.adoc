:description: An example of how to perform data backups and restore the state based on the backup.
:keywords: dev-ops, DevOps, CLI, command-line interface, maintenance

We recommend backing up your database and uploaded files regularly.
It is also highly recommended to backup before you upgrade to a more recent {PRODUCT_NAME} version.

[TIP]
====
You can define a cron job that backups your data to external storage.
====

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote* add some example setups, as we have now with a CRON job?

[#reduce-size]
== Reducing Backup Size

For some cases, you can omit specific database tables which allow you to reduce the size of the backup.
This reduction also comes in handy when you wish to migrate your production database to your local instance.

[cols="2s,5a"]
|===
| [#backup-optional_table-auth_sessions]#<<backup-optional_table-auth_sessions,auth_sessions>>#
| The `auth_sessions` table stores user's authentication sessions.
If you omit this table, the users will have to re-login after the database is restored.
The `auth_sessions` table can safely be omitted in any case.

| [#backup-optional_table-credentials]#<<backup-optional_table-credentials,credentials>>#
| The `credentials` table stores authentication related secrets such as passwords, reset tokens, and email confirmation tokens.
If you omit the `credentials` table all issued credentials will need to be re-issues requiring your users to reset their passwords, re-send the password reset emails, and re-send the email confirm emails.
The `credentials` table can can safely be omitted in any case where some cases might recommend for it to be omitted.

| [#backup-optional_table-auth_oa2tokens]#<<backup-optional_table-auth_oa2tokens,auth_oa2tokens>>#
| The `auth_oa2tokens` table stores access tokens issues by the {PRODUCT_NAME} server to web applications.
If you omit the `auth_oa2tokens` table all of the access tokens will be invalidated and will need to be re-issued.
The `auth_oa2tokens` table can safely be omitted in any case where some cases might recommend for it to be omitted.

[CAUTION]
====
If you invalidate access tokens all of the authenticated web applications must re-authenticate.
This could cause issues for cases where the web application only re-generates tokens when they are scheduled to expire.
====

| [#backup-optional_table-actionlog]#<<backup-optional_table-actionlog,actionlog>>#
| The `actionlog` table stores events the {PRODUCT_NAME} server considered significant, such as creating users, registering auth clients, and looking up records.
If you omit the `actionlog` table the action history will be lost.
The `actionlog` table can safely be omitted for development related cases.

| [#backup-optional_table-automation_sessions]#<<backup-optional_table-automation_sessions,automation_sessions>>#
| The `automation_sessions` table stores metadata regarding workflow execution such as what step the workflow is on, what parameters were passed to the workflow, and the outcome of the execution.
If you omit the `automation_sessions` table the workflow execution history will be lost and any prompted or suspended workflows will not complete.
The `automation_sessions` table can safely be omitted for development related cases.

| [#backup-optional_table-compose_record]#<<backup-optional_table-compose_record,compose_record>>#
| The `compose_record` table stores record metadata created in your {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} applications.
If you omit the `compose_record` table all of the records created for your {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} applications will be lost.
The `compose_record` table can be omitted if you want to backup the system structure but omit all of the data.

| [#backup-optional_table-compose_record_value]#<<backup-optional_table-compose_record_value,compose_record_value>>#
| The `compose_record_value` table stores record values created in your {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} applications.
If you omit the `compose_record_value` table all of the records created for your {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} applications will be lost.
The `compose_record_value` table can be omitted if you want to backup the system structure but omit all of the data.

| [#backup-optional_table-queue_messages]#<<backup-optional_table-queue_messages,queue_messages>>#
| The `queue_messages` table stores the messages passed into the messaging queue.
If you omit the `queue_messages` table all of the messages passed into the messaging queue will be lost.
The `queue_messages` table can safely be dropped for most cases.

| [#backup-optional_table-resource_activity_log]#<<backup-optional_table-resource_activity_log,resource_activity_log>>#
| The `resource_activity_log` table stores the history of resource changes such as record value changes.
If you omit the `resource_activity_log` table the history of all resources will be lost.
The `resource_activity_log` table can safely be omitted for development cases.

== MySQL Database

If you're using a different database engine, refer to their documentation on how to perform backups.

=== Backup

[NOTE]
====
Refer to the <<reduce-size,reducing backup size>> section to see what tables you can omit for your use-case.
An example command which omits specific tables is available below.
====

We recommend you use the `mysqldump` tool.
It's builtin into the `db` container (`percona:8.0` image).

[CAUTION]
====
Do not attempt to copy raw database files to perform a backup.
It might lead to corrupted data.
====

[WARNING]
====
By default, `mysqldump` locks the tables when you run the export.
Table locks might cause issues when running in production, so do keep this in mind.
====

.Database dump command:
[source,bash]
----
# This dumps the entire database and place it in the dump.sql file.
docker-compose exec -T \
    --env MYSQL_PWD=your-password db \
    mysqldump your-db-name --add-drop-database -u your-username > dump.sql

# This dumps the database without actionlog, automation sessions, and resource activity log
# These are generally the largest and can safely be omitted.
docker-compose exec -T \
    --env MYSQL_PWD=your-password db \
    mysqldump your-db-name --add-drop-database --ignore-table=dbname.actionlog --ignore-table=dbname.automation_sessions --ignore-table=dbname.resource_activity_log -u your-username > dump.sql
----

[CAUTION]
====
If you've changed the database service name (`db`) inside your `docker-compose.yaml`, make sure to change it in the above command.
====

=== Restoration

[NOTE]
====
We recommend that {PRODUCT_NAME} server is shut-down until the restore procedure finishes.
====

.Database restore command:
[source,bash]
----
# This restores the database based on the dump.sql file.
docker-compose exec -T \
    --env MYSQL_PWD=your-password db \
    mysql your-db-name -u your-username < dump.sql
----

[CAUTION]
====
If you've changed the database service name (`db`) inside your `docker-compose.yaml`, make sure to change it in the above command.
====

== PostgreSQL Database

=== Backup

[NOTE]
====
Refer to the <<reduce-size,reducing backup size>> section to see what tables you can omit for your use-case.
An example command which omits specific tables is available below.
====

We recommend you use the `pg_dumpall` or `pg_dump` tool.
`pg_dumpall` is a utility for writing out ("dumping") all PostgreSQL databases of a cluster into one script file.
The script file contains SQL commands that can be used as input to psql to restore the databases.
It does this by calling `pg_dump` for each database in a cluster.

[CAUTION]
====
Do not try to copy raw database files to perform a backup.
It might lead to corrupted data.
====

[WARNING]
====
By default, `pg_dump` locks the tables when you run the export.
Table locks might cause issues when running in production, so do keep this in mind.
====

.Database Dump Command:
[source,bash]
----
# This dumps all databases and place them in the dump.sql file.
docker-compose exec db \
    pg_dumpall -c -U your-username > dump.sql

# This dumps the entire database and place it in the dump.sql file.
docker-compose exec db \
    pg_dump -d your-db-name -c -U your-username > dump.sql

# To reduce the size of the sql,
# This dumps all databases and place them in the dump.gz file.
docker-compose exec db \
    pg_dumpall -c -U your-username | \
    gzip > /var/data/postgres/backups/dump.gz


# This dumps the database without actionlog, automation sessions, and resource activity log
# These are generally the largest and can safely be omitted.
docker-compose exec db \
    pg_dump -T corteza.actionlog -T corteza.automation_sessions -T corteza.resource_activity_log -c -U your-username corteza > dump.sql
----

[CAUTION]
====
If you've changed the database service name (`db`) inside your `docker-compose.yaml`, make sure to also change it in the above command.
====

=== Restoration

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended that {PRODUCT_NAME} server is shut-down until the restore procedure finishes.
====

.Database Restore Command:
[source,bash]
----
# This restores the database based on the dump.sql file.
cat dump.sql | \
    docker-compose exec db psql -U your-username

# This restores a specific database based on the dump.sql file.
cat dump.sql | \
    docker-compose exec db psql -U your-username -d your-db-name

# To restore a compressed sql,
# This restores the database based on the dump.gz file.
gzip < dump.gz | \
    docker-compose exec db psql -U your-username
----

[CAUTION]
====
If you've changed the database service name (`db`) inside your `docker-compose.yaml`, make sure to change it in the above command.
====

== Files

=== Backup

Without object storage service like Min.io, uploaded files are stored directly on the filesystem.
{PRODUCT_NAME} server stores data to the `/data` directory (if not configured differently with `*_STORAGE_PATH` environmental variables).

You can use any standard file management tools to make a backup copy of the files.

.Compressing files with the `tar` command:
[source,bash]
----
# This compresses all your uploaded files into the backup.tar.bz2 archive,
tar -cjf backup.tar.bz2 data/server/
----
=== Restore

.Uncompressing files from the archive with the `tar` command:
[source,bash]
----
# This restores your backup.tar.bz2 archive
tar -xjf backup.tar.bz2
----
